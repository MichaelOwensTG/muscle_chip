# Muscle_Chip
Documentation of muscle chip research, along with variations of my work.

This is a collection of my previous work done at the Wallops Flight Facility (WFF) and research paper work. This is the combination of the Sounding Rockets One team work and ideas, led by the master teacher Robert Wu-Rorrer and our subject matter expert, David Bowker.
