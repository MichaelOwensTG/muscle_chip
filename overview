##  Mission Overview
The **Gravitational Response In Tissues (GRIT)** mission studies how human tissues respond to changing gravitational forces during a sounding rocket flight. Using **organ-on-a-chip (OoC)** systems, GRIT investigates **ocular**, **hepatic**, and **skeletal muscle** tissue reactions under **hypergravity** and **microgravity** conditions.

The mission aims to:
- Advance understanding of tissue behavior in spaceflight environments.  
- Support design improvements for astronaut suits and biomedical monitoring.  
- Provide data for NASA’s Artemis and Gateway programs.  

Launch site: **NASA Wallops Flight Facility, Virginia**  
Rocket: **Black Brant XII-A Sounding Rocket**  
Launch date: **August 2030**

##  Instrumentation Summary

| Sensor / System | Function | Measurement Focus |
|-----------------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Accelerometer (G-Force Sensor)** | Measures acceleration and G-forces | Quantifies dynamic loading during flight |
| **Barometer** | Records pressure during ascent and re-entry | Evaluates tissue stress under varying atmospheric pressures |
| **Vibrometer** | Detects mechanical vibrations | Assesses vibration-induced stress and detachment risk |
| **Thermo-Hygrometer** | Monitors temperature and humidity | Ensures tissue viability by tracking environmental stability |
| **Microbalance** | Measures tissue mass changes | Detects contraction, swelling, and degradation |
| **Ion-Selective Electrode (ISE)** | Detects specific ions (Ca²⁺, Na⁺, K⁺) | Tracks ion exchange during muscle excitation |
| **Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT)** | Non-invasive imaging | Reveals microstructural changes pre- and post-flight |
| **Telemetry System** | Transmits and stores data | Sends experiment data to ground receivers |
| **Iridium GPS Tracker** | Ensures payload recovery | Enables water-based retrieval post-splashdown |
